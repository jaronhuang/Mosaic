## To compile the application
1.  Ensure you have Xcode and its appropriate iOS device simulator installed.
    
2.  Clone the repository
    
3.  Open XCode. On OSX, use the toolbar on the top left to select File > Open and then select the “ios/Runner.xcodeproj” file in the unzipped folder.
    
4.  From the top left menu within the XCode menu, select the iOS device on which you would like to run the app (the app is designed for use on an iPhone 11). Appropriately resolve any warnings if they appear, and then click the “play” button on the same menu.
